# Technical Design Document Template

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the design specifications for new features or systems, ensuring alignment across the development team and stakeholders.

## Introduction
Provide an overview of the project, including the background and context necessary to understand the design choices made.

- **Project Name:** `Enter project name`
- **Document Author:** @mention (to notify the team member responsible)
- **Date Created:** `>Enter creation date`
- **Last Updated:** `>Enter last updated date`
- **Stakeholders:** @mention (tag stakeholders for visibility)

## Objectives
List the goals and objectives this design aims to achieve. For example:

- [ ] Objective 1: Describe the primary goal of the feature or system.
- [ ] Objective 2: Outline secondary objectives or considerations.

## Architecture Diagrams
Include diagrams that illustrate the high-level architecture of the system or feature. Use attachments or links to diagrams stored within NotePlan for easy access.

- **System Overview Diagram:** `Link to diagram`
- **Component Interaction:** `Link to diagram`

## Design Details
