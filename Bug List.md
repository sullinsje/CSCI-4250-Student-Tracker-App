# Known Bug List:

* **Trying to register after failing to login fails:**  
  * Likely an easy fix, probably due to remaining on Auth and not having a way to get to the register page.

* **Clicking the homebar after logging in takes you to login, but the homebar still looks like you’re logged in:**  
  * Might require more effort to fix. Would need to either update login pages and/or create a tab to take you back to the homepage of whatever you’re logged in as.
